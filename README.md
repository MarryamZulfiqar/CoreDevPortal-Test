# 👋🏼 What is `Core Developer Playground`?

We made this decentralized application (dApp) to help developers learn about development on Web3 using Core.

It's a Next.js app that uses React, TypeScript and smart contract languages (mostly Solidity).

We will guide you through using the various blockchain JavaScript SDKs to interact with the Core network.
